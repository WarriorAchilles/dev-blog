Zion Emond is a software engineer at CQL, an agency specializing in creating custom eCommerce websites. In his spare time, he likes to build apps that will provide both a technical challenge to create, pushing his skills farther, while also providing value to end users by solving a problem and improving something in their lives

When not professionally problem solving with code, Zion enjoys playing music, usually on the piano, though he has been known to dabble in other instruments. In addition to this, he enjoys playing online games with his friends, spending lots of time in Discord voice chats as well as constantly lurking in the text channels.

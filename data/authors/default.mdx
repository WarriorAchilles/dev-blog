Full-Stack Software Engineer with 3+ years of experience building scalable, high-performance web and mobile applications using React, Next.js, Node.js, and TypeScript at an eCommerce software development agency. Exhibits leadership by leading support projects and directly communicating with stakeholders. Skilled in developing full-stack web applications, integrating RESTful and GraphQL APIs, and deploying to AWS and Azure. Passionate about learning new things every day and delivering quality solutions.

Some examples of my results include:

- Optimized frontend and backend performance of client's e-commerce site to handle over 10x traffic surge during product launch, enabling $2M+ in sales
- Developed CLI tool using Node.js and GraphQL to reduce admin configuration time by over 75% when transferring Shopify metafields and metaobjects, including setting up CI/CD pipeline for deployment of new package versions
- Spearheaded development of recurring billing and management system and RESTful API hosted in AWS and written in TypeScript with Node.js, allowing client to develop an internal customer service platform to improve ability of their CSRs
- Contributing to various open source projects

I get excited about opportunities where I’m able to work with high-performing, tight-knit teams developing frontend and backend applications and have fun while doing it. I love making good UI/UX designs real, along with making backend systems work efficiently.

In addition to shipping quality code, I love contributing to the culture wherever I work. I’ve volunteered to help organize company events ranging from laid back hangouts to high-stakes games of Among Us!
On more of a personal note, I love music. I’ve played the piano since I was six years old, and I volunteer at my church by being a part of the worship team and playing piano three times a week for worship.

I also love to travel. So far my favorite destination has been Iceland, but I’m sure I can find other destinations to give it a run for its Króna.

But more than anything, I love learning. Learning and problem solving drive just about everything I do. I love figuring out how things work. That “Ah-ha!” moment when everything clicks and I’m able to act on my newfound knowledge is the best feeling ever.

Also, I love connecting with new people! Contact me at zionemond.dev@gmail.com or over on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zion-emond-dev/)!

summary: Homepage is coming along. I wonder if I could add ChatGPT to the homepage...?

Homepage is starting to come together. Even though I'm not a designer of any sort, I'm pretty proud of how this is starting to come together. It needs a lot more polishing still, but it's moving in a very good direction.

I have a crazy idea to include a ChatGPT API query on the homepage that generates a new subheading every time you load the page. Doesn't seem like the API is free but looks like it would be super cheap (pennies) to do something that simple.

I got the idea since I've been using ChatGPT to help me come up with the copy and headlines. It works amazing as a brainstorming tool.

This was a quick, 6-week long internship during my senior year of college.

Some of the work I did during this time included:

- Leading research into CI/CD tools Maven and Gradle to determine best fit for migrating legacy internal workflows and prepared research findings to be presented to decision makers.
- Developing solutions to improve performance and user experience for internal applications

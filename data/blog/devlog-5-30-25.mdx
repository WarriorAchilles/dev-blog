draft: false
summary: Finished basic homepage design and updated portfolio
---

Finished the design of the homepage. Finally got the fish watermark to display how I want it to and still be mobile responsive.

I also added the MERC site and CQL to my portfolio page, along with blog posts that have links to the related sites.

Tweaked some styling/positioning here and there.

Next up: connect ChatGPT to the front page to generate new taglines, and see if I need to polish any of the text descriptions in random places

summary: CHATGPT ON THE HOMEPAGE

Super proud of this. Was able to get a ChatGPT API call wired up to the homepage so it generates a new tagline on a button click. Might tweak the input query a bit from time to time, but overall it looks and works great.

I also added a typing animation so it looks like the new tagline is being typed in every time. I think it's pretty cool. Hopefully it's a cool twist and not tacky.

Styling was super finicky but I think I'm finally happy with it. I've also got a loading spinner added for when the tagline is generating.

I think this site is just about finished.

Shopify Metafield Migrator is a CLI tool for copying Shopify Metafield and Metaobject definitions from one Shopify store to another. This tool is primarily designed for transferring configurations from development stores to production stores.

I started this project to help some speed up a process for some coworkers, but then I realized how useful it was, so I decided to polish it up and make it much more user-friendly and widely available. If it was useful for a few coworkers, it'll probably be useful for other people!

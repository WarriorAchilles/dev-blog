summary: The start of my devlogs.
---

I'm going to try to start keeping a devlog of the projects I work on.

First things first, this website. I've spent some time over the last few days getting the site set up and customized.
I still need to customize the front page, it's currently still just a bland blog frontpage.

There's a lot of bloat in this website template I'm using, at some point I'll need to clean it up. I'm keeping most of it for now
in case I need it for reference while I'm still learning how this template works.

Biggest things I've gotten done so far:

- Created a color palette
- Updated the colors on the website
    - This took longer than I expected, since I was learning tailwind for the first time. Pretty cool now that I'm getting it figured out though.
- Set up hosting on Vercel
- Started customizing homepage

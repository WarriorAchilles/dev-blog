I manage the website for Medical Equipment Resource Consultants (MERC), a company that specializes in helping hospitals and healthcare facilities maximize the value of their medical equipment.
The website is built with WordPress, and I make use of a child theme and several plugins to help accomplish my client's goals.

In addition to redesigning and updating the site, I help offer consulting advice for best practice, along with SEO strategies. I ensure the site is optimized to bring leads in to the business.

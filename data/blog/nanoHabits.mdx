summary: an AI-powered habit tracking app designed to help users accomplish their goals and become better versions of themselves
---

NanoHabits is an app I'm building. Once I finish it I'll update this post, but it's currently a WIP.

The goal is to build a minimalist habit tracker app. Eventually, the goal is to use AI to help users break down their larger goals into smaller, actionable habits.

To start, I'm just building an MVP to get it launched and get feedback.

See the repo for the app [here](https://github.com/WarriorAchilles/NanoHabits)

I'm also documenting the process on Instagram. If you're interested, check out the [account](https://www.instagram.com/nano.habits/)

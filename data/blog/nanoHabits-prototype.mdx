summary: A prototype built with discord.js
---

As a prototype of NanoHabits, I built a little discord bot to help prove to myself that I could build something.

It was quick and dirty, the code isn't very complete or clean, but it worked enough to make me feel confident that I could build the real thing.

See the repo for the prototype [here](https://github.com/WarriorAchilles/habit-bot)

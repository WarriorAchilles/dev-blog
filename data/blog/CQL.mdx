My current day job. CQL is a custom ecommerce development agency that specializes in building high-quality, scalable, and secure ecommerce solutions.
In my day to day role, I work with a team of talented developers with technologies such as Reach, Node.js, TypeScript, ASP.NET, and more.
I use platforms such as AWS, Azure, Shopify Plus, BigCommerce, and Salesforce Commerce Cloud, to build solutions that are the best fit for our clients.

We have worked with some major brands across many industries such as 4Patriots, PetSmart, Denon, and TOMS.

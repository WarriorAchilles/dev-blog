# About

This repo serves as the source for the dev blog and portfolio of Zion Emond.

Zion Emond is a software engineer at CQL, an agency specializing in creating custom eCommerce websites.

In addition to this, he enjoys playing online games with his friends, spending lots of time in Discord voice chats as well as constantly lurking in the text channels.
